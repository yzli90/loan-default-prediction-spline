Last summer, I started researching pet sitting/dog walking as an alternative business, because I would like to stay within my home area.  I became interested in pet sitting by the way of managing bed and breakfasts for owners who want vacations, take medical leave, etc. They also have pets. I took care of these pets along with daily walks.  In December of 2007, I tentatively opened for business. I know from my research that banks will not loan to me as there is no overhead or building that I am renting or buying.  What I am looking for is marketing and personal finance money to get me through the next three months. I do have jobs lined up for summer, but right now I have two big marketing shows lined up and need the financing now.  I feel if I focus my time on marketing aggressively, (door to door, trade shows, fairs, meetings with vets, groomers, mailings) I can reach my goal by summer.  I have ran the numbers and technically if I get 4-6  dogs or cats a day on a routine basis I can have a fully operational and viable business. There are 42,000 licensed dog owners in my county alone. 10,000 that are not licensed and most of these live in apartments, where my business can be a great asset.

Our income did not match it after it got beyond us and we ended up in debt.  We went to Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and ended up even leading a class helping others to get out of debt and live debt-free as we are in the middle of doing.    We have had NO credit cards (we stopped using them long ago and then cut them up).  We work two jobs each bringing in now around $90K a year.  We live on a budget and cash envelope system.  We make timely payments always on our things (as my credit report will show).  Our credit rating is 720 even after all this. We have added $0 to our debt in the same time period as well!  Though our debt is larger than that we have been paying on, with this loan we would pay off at least one high-interest credit card (we already cut up long ago) and much of a smaller Home Equity loan.  This would bring our number of loans to pay off debt down to two eventually, have a lower interest rate over all, and lower monthly payment - also it would enable us to possibly be in a position to pay off more rapidly the remaining balance on the Home Equity loan.    We have lived on budget, faith, hard work for a year and we are going to kill the debt as we remain on this path.

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have spent the last several years cleaning up my credit and will not allow myself to go anywhere but forward at this point. I have a come a long way in building up my credit worthiness.  The sole cause of my past credit problems is due to mistakes I made years ago involving my student loans (listed as seven different accounts on my credit report because they're broken down by semester). A few years back, after falling way behind in my payments, I worked out a restructuring deal with the supplier of these student loans. They brought my account current and I have since had one simple payment per month. I have never been late in these payments, and this has allowed me to slowly watch my credit health improve as time treks on. I am very proud of this.  The other three active debt accounts listed on my credit report are two credit cards and a computer loan, with a combined total owed of $3200. These accounts, as mentioned above, will be completely eliminated with this Prosper loan.   I have been employed with the same company for four years now, and job security is no concern. However, I make less in the slower winter months than in the spring, summer and fall. This is the reason for the cusion mentioned above. Although I usually have more cash saved for these slow months, I have overextended myself a bit by sending in higher-than-required student loan payments this year.   I have a lot to look forward to in my life. I have been blessed in 2007, having met the girl I hope to spend many wonderful years with.

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled.

Several years ago I ran into a bit of trouble when my husband had 2 heart attacks in 10 months and could not work and our income was reduced by over 60%.  But since then I have remanaged to rebuild with my own income and stay current with no DQ's  in the past 5 years.  I'm stable being a home owner.

I have a $10,000 check sitting next to me that I have not cashed due to the interest rate attached to it.   I will not be adding debt only managing more wisely the debt I have incurred.  Someone is going to be getting the interest on my money, it might as well be the people who have faith in me.    Monthly net income: $ variable as to what is going on an how  much I put in my 401k plan or which insurances I carry.  I pay my bills first but always try to put a little extra away.

He has been there since 1999.  Before that we worked at the Raybestos Factory in Manheim,PA.  He was there nineteen years and I was there thirteen years.  The business closed up.   I have been working as much overtime as possible.  Usually six or seven days a week.  Over Christmas the factory closed down for eleven days.  I needed to put in a waiting week, so therefore I am still playing catch up with that.  The money would be use to pay off the  credit cards and close them out.  The interest rates on those cards are all over the place.  So I would want to pay them off.  If I could pay them off with one interest rate instead of many, I could put the extra money back into our savings account,which currently is at zero.  I feel strongly that we need a cushion.   Thanks for taking the time to read this.

It was expensive to get here and is expensive to stay here.  The loan is straight up to pay off all existing credit card debt and a little on the side to go into savings.  I thought of doing consumer credit counseling but with that, it's apparently better if you're behind in your payments -which I'm not.

I trust you will find this to be a unique, and quite interesting, so I thank you for your support. My business is APK Developments, LLC, which started in 2002 to develop advanced shift systems for the motorsports market. These are semi-automatic shift systems for motorcycles, race cars which use sequential transmissions. In recent years, this has been a booming market due to advancements in manufacturing techniques which have made sequential transmissions more affordable, increasing their demand, and the demand for shift systems to extract the full potential of a sequential setup. The purpose of this loan is capital for the numerous R&D projects current, file for patents, manufacturing add-ons, and brand building.   My current position: I work a day job, so this is done on the side, and has been treated as a hobby so far. This past year I took the next step to make this into something and funded heavily in setting up a place of business, as seen in the above photos. A couple years ago, the MS-100 was developed, which is the fastest air shift system on the market for drag motorcycles. Last year, the MS-120 quick shifter was introduced, which is the only system on the market for motorcycles that automatically adjusts each shift, so that each shift, is at it's optimum. This is one of the things to be patented. Currently, plug and play kits are being developed for popular bikes to provide the customer with a simple installation. Market indications for the MS-120 are great, as there are people waiting for plug and play kits to be available for their bike, however, I can not supply the demand without the needed manufacturing add-ons. Note that a number of these customers have been waiting for months, when they could have gone with the lower priced competitors products. This speaks volumes for my product, which is made to the highest standards.  What's in R&D? A market I didn't forsee with these shift systems is that of mobility aids. I regularly get requests for a system to be developed to up and downshift a motorcycle for disabled riders. This niche would allow injured riders (the primary request) to get back on a bike. I have found one company that produces a viable system, however it is primitive, and I have heard of many comments on it's bulkiness. Everyone requesting me to develop a system compliment the quality present in my products, and hope to see the same in a system designed for this niche. This challenge in R&D has resulted in a system in development, that will need a number of patents filed.  Secondly, is that of the race car market. With paddle shift systems gaining in popularity, there is a need for more cost effective systems for the middle levels of motorsports. For the lower levels (amatuer), higher quality systems at an affordable price.   As for brand building: The website is being completely redesigned (almost done). The company logo has been updated. A marketing plan is in place, and needs to be executed. This is initially done by sponsoring motorcycle racers for the coming season, which is an investment in itself.

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.

We started looking a ServiceMagic.com and found it to be way to expensive and the leads where given not just to him but every contractor in the area. So by the time he called around the customer was just aggravated from to many calls. I took upon a task to built him a simple website that would get him the leads, but we notice this was not making any progress so i started to research how internet works and found google, yahoo and msn have great marketing and advertising tools that help out small business but although it was effective we found it to be expensive. I then realized a term called SEO/SEM (Search Engine Optimization/Search Engine Marketing) six months later after a few classes and plenty of research and books i was able get him top rankings for contractors in his area of business, best of all the website was getting natural ads in google, yahoo and msn top ten ads on those three search engines is tuff you not only need to be established but you have to be loud on the internet!! So we did it and he started getting his first 1-3calls a day then we turned to 5-10 and now we get roughly 7-15 calls but my avg is 7 calls during winter season when trees, fences and roofs have plenty of accidents and problems. We have yet to experience a summer but i could only imagine. My uncle and i agreed $10.00 a call was fair weather or not the job got done. He then referred a friend of his with a Janitorial Company and the model works for his business as well, so i decide to offer this great tool to other small business in the area. A bit hesitant to the new idea a lot of business turned me down but that didn't stop my persistence, so i offered the service Free for the first month. Yes I told them i would help your business succeed as long as you give me the chance to show you what i could do. After adding 4 more clients i found myself, not only creating and maintaining the websites but also doing the marking  on a daily basis for all 6 clients this included taking the initial call, tracking the calls, invoicing my clients, and lots of other business administration stuff that took a regular 12-15hr days after six months i noticed my health and wife were really getting sick of a workaholic so, I recently started looking for software that would do most of the marketing for me and i also found a outsourcing company that would take the calls, track the calls and best yet invoice my clients. I also need to higher a accountant, My focus will be in getting more clients and i found that to be easy with my 30 day free trial period with no risk to a small business. This loan will go along way and i am currently taking Video classes to help our clients get there message across to there customers.  best wishes to all,   ",small_business,looking foward to expand ,958xx,CA,8.8,1.0,Feb-2000,675.0,679.0,4.0,19.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,8045.0,49.7,22.0,f,0.0,0.0,5208.490000000002,3430.47,3399.8,1423.35,0.0,385.34,4.02,Feb-2009,402.56,Oct-2009,Oct-2016,594.0,590.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.

We are good candidates for a loan as we are also rebuilding our financial lives from slow growth entrepreneurial ventures. Interestingly, we have a new venture that is about to be launched. It is www.myrollingstocks.com . The site provides information on Options strategies as well as on US and Canadian rolling stocks. We will also add an investment club (5% monthly returns) to this site. Participation in the investment club will be by invitation only (because of SEC rules pertaining to investment clubs)  Any DQs on my report are from 2003 to 2004 after I jumped from the corporate world to run Nature Isle (an entrepreneurial venture) – which is still viable and could be a potential hit in the near future   The Nature Isle venture has been around since 2001 and while slow to grow, (www.naturegourmet.com) has vast potential as it expands nationally.

Stupidly (of course!) I managed to justify almost two thousand dollars in purchases during my time abroad as ""necessities"" (as in, I'll never be here again!) After coming back to the States, I had trouble making monthly payments since I had virtually no income, especially once the APR on Card #1 when from 0% up to 22%. To try and solve the problem, I opened up Card #2 and transferred the balance--but eventually charged Card #1 right back up.  So here I am, only able to afford minimum monthly payments. I no longer use either card (they are in an envelope in a filing cabinet at home) as I've FINALLY realized the evil of using the credit card. I'm at my first job out of college making less than $30,000 per year, and all I want is to get rid of this credit card debt. It seems like I'm paying hundreds of dollars monthly, but I'm never seeing the principal balances go down.   I also have a fairly large student loan to pay off, but those payments are actually much more manageable--I just feel like Card #1 and #2 have been a total drain on my bank account for the last few years. Being able to pay them both off with an $8000 loan would allow me to have a much simpler debt to control with a foreseeable END, which is the most important thing to me.

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!

Due to a rare genetic condition that I have that could be passed on to our child, my wife and I have decided to adopt.  We are very excited because my wife has three adopted sisters from Africa, and it has been a great experience.  We have great credit and a good income; however the adoption costs are around $25,000 so we would like to use a loan to spread our cash flow out a little.  We will get reimbursed for over half of this loan from my company and from our tax refunds within the next year, so there should be no problem paying the loan back.  We are just trying to not have to dip into our savings too much.  We would greatly appreciate a loan that will help us to make our dream of our first child come true.  As a young couple we really need the help in getting our family started.  My financial situation: As my profile shows, I have excellent credit.  My family owns a car dealership, so we don't have a car payment.  We only have our mortgage, a couple of college loans from my Masters degree, and we pay off our credit cards every month and only use them to get airline miles.  I have a good job as a software project manager and make over $80,000 a year.  I also have an extremely good debt to income ratio.  I have a solid history of debt repayment with no late payments ever on my mortgage or credit cards.  My profile shows one delinquency which is a mistake on my credit report that I have in dispute with an old apartment complex.  Otherwise, I have perfect credit and thus a very low credit risk.

However, because of the high cost of rent in our area, we won't be able to make more than the minimum payments on our credit cards for 6 months (when we move to a cheaper apartment), and the amount above the minimum that we will be afford when we move will be much lower than we'd like.  A personal loan like this would allow us to begin paying off our debt immediately, and to pay it off much more quickly.

I moved down here from Maryland, the summer after I graduated from college. I graduated magna cum laude, ending my undergraduate career with a cumulative GPA of 3.94, and promptly obtained a full-time job with benefits upon moving to the south. While I was in school I worked part time (anywhere from 10 to 25 hours per week extra) to pay for my tuition, as well as had several jobs on campus (tutoring, and during my last year I was a Resident Assistant in one of the dorms).  Money has always been a bit tight but I put it towards my education and other necessary expenses.  It has become necessary for me to seek other residency elsewhere in Atlanta. The relationship that I moved for is failing and has become an unhealthy situation for both people. However, I enjoy my job and do not want to leave it; I am doing well at the company and enjoy working.  It's important to me now that I seek another place to live as soon as possible, even though my finances do not specifically allow for it (due to recent medical expenses).

I withdrew most of the funds from my brokerage account 3 years ago to pay off a credit card, and to assist a friend in getting rid of some of her inefficient debt a well.  I have since been recompensed over time (charged her no interest).  My mortgage debt is structured very efficiently.  5.0% fixed 30 year mortgage, 5.24% (prime minus 1.26% variable) HELOC.  I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.

My wife of 30 years returned to college at the age of 44 and earned her Associates Degree in Construction Technology/Victorian Restoration, so in 2004 with my wife as the Carpenter and myself as the Electrician/Plumber we gutted the inside, borrowed $100K and spent the next 14 months turning it into an Inn with 3 guest rooms. We opened for business in January 2006 and had a pretty good first year ($36K), but we soon learned that we needed more rooms finished to accommodate the number of guests wanting to stay with us. In April I borrowed $10K from CashCall (39.99%) which we used to get 2 more rooms up and running before the 2007 tourist season. I also bought a computer system for the business from Dell (29.99%). We now have 5 guest rooms and have increased our income to a projected $45K for 2007. We expect our business to keep growing as we become better known and have all 8 rooms available for guests.

I would like to furnish my apartment, but i can not get a loan because my credit score is too low.  I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.    I would like to request a loan in the amount of $15,000.  I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

The intent of this loan is to simplify my credit situation with a fixed interest rate over a fixed term so that I can pay off my credit card debt more quickly and with less stress.  Previously, I tried to consolidate my unsecured debt with a non-profit organization, but some of my lenders refused to consolidate or even lower my interest rates.   And while the consolidated credit cards were reduced significantly, the others lingered with high interest rates.    By simplifying my credit card debt and moving to a fixed interest and fixed term loan, I can lower my payments and make a solid plan for repayment.    Currently, I am paying nearly 300.00 a month in credit card debt, scattered across several creditors and I am still paying the minimum! My debt seems to be lingering as a result.  My plan is to reduce my payments monthly to $200.00 or less.  My fiance and I would like to be able to pay for the entire wedding out-of-pocket and without extensive use of credit resources.  Because I am putting so much out each month in credit card debt, my ability to save has been slim.

Networks,5 years,RENT,53307.0,Not Verified,Feb-2008,Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=258644,"Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in ""context"" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar’s ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read… well I won’t digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History.

Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location – walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan – I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value – I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

This is a skill I want to master to create wealth.  I'm also enjoying the experience as I don't ""need"" the money.  I don't have a mortgage, my income exceeds my expenses and I'm very meticulous about spending.  I have good control over myself mentally, spiritually and emotionally, therefore I have good control over my money. My only debt is a car lease and a interest free care credit loan for my lasik (i could have paid cash but why not get interest free financing).  My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?  Again, this is for the experience, I can comfortably afford the loan and interest, but I think this experience will make me better in business.

I have been struggling with debt for the past 6 years.  I graduated from college with a degree in accounting in May of 2005.  Although my wonderful father paid for my tuition through school, I was living on my own all through school and depended on a part-time job and credit cards to pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc.   After I graduated, I was lucky enough to find my dream job rather quickly.  A junior accountant at a small,local CPA firm.  I have been there for 2 years now and have since been promoted to a senior.  Since getting this new job, I have gotten my debt down from 13,000 to 4,500.  I have contacted all the credit card companies asking for lower rates, but they say I cant have one because of the missed payments from years ago.  I feel so overwhelmed sometimes, I cant sleep.  I have 3 different credit cards all due at different times not to mention a car payment, rent, utilities, etc.  I have asked all the credit card companies for higher limits so I could consolidate to make one payment, but again, 2-3 years ago, when I was working 20 hours a week at a grocery store and going to school full time I had late payments and overdraft charges (mostly due to the late payment fees).  I am asking for this loan so that I can finally be free of this debt, and stop it from looming over my head.  I am planning to get married this fall and we both hope to be debt free before then, so we will be able to start saving for a house.

The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother.

With this loan, it is my goal and utmost priority to pay it back as quickly as possible.  Currently I have 5 major accounts I would like to settle, and in addition, pay the final costs of a long awaited and much anticipated wedding ring for my fiance.  I realize the responsibility required for the transition I am about to make, and debt consolidation is only the begining step.  I have been stable in my position with Lithia Motors as one of their leading IT Professionals for 2 years now, and have raised my credit score out of the depths from my earlier years growing up and experiencing the world.  In addition Federal and State funds are making their way back to me per this year's tax season.  This will help me achieve paying this debt back quicker than just my base salary alone.  Most of my immediate family also resides in this region, and we have always helped each other in times of need.  LendingClub, with your assistance, together we can take these Steps To Success in this journey of life.

I also have an investment property which has a high rate 2nd mortgage.    After seeing the idea on Suze Orman (I watch a lot of CNBC), I transferred some higher rate debt through balance transfers on some credit cards that had lower rates. This was working out great except that 1) the balance transfers made my credit utilization on the cards high which 2) lowered my FICO score which 3) lead two of my credit card lenders to jack up my rate despite my prior good payment history.  I abhore these practices by the credit card industry and would much rather pay my fellow Lending Club members each month.  I may be paying this off early as I have a six-figure executive equity package with my company which pays out next year.

Status:Charged Off,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=62774,"About me: I'm a young, ambitious, and excited student, father and future husband. The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctor’s bills and auto repairs from last year. All of that is now resolved and we are paying everything down, and I’ve never missed a payment on anything.",educational,Adopt a math student!,294xx,SC,29.6,0.0,Sep-2003,675.0,679.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,3043.0,58.5,6.0,f,0.0,0.0,1142.79,950.68,649.65,359.71,0.0,133.43,1.39,Dec-2008,126.4,Aug-2009,Oct-2016,594.0,590.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I am a 29 year old working professional determined to pay down my credit card debt at a lower interest rate.  In my early twenties, I tried to make ends meet by using my credit cards. I now see that cutting my expenses and only buying things I can afford are what enable me to make ends meet and have money remaining.   My use for this loan will be for the sole purpose of paying off my credit cards and having one monthly payment for this loan. My DTL ratio is high due to my credit card balances, but I pay my bills on time. Once I have paid my loan back in full, I will begin saving for my first home. Yay!  I am college graduate employed full time with a stable company. By living with a relative, I have been able to save a great deal of money with a below-market rent payment and shared utilities.

I make a goo living, and never have a problem paying my credit cards.. and alway  on time. and always a bit more than the minimum.  I was looking at a debt calculator, and realized it would take me years..even decades to pay off the cards, and ending up having to pay so much extra money in interest in that time.  WHY would I do that when I can hopefully get a loan, pay just about what I am paying now, and be done with it in 3 years.   I understand my credit grade below doesn't look like I am a good risk.  I have discussed my scores and why I received this grade with a finance counselor - it is  because of my debt ratio/usage of credit accounts.  My payment history and age of accounts scored an A.  I understand the value of good credit - which is why you are reading thsi now. I can and WILL payback on time.. something you hopefully soon find out :)  I have been employed at the same company in the Bay Area for 7 years (in May).  It's a great job - one which I have no plans on leaving.  I opted not to list the name of the company on my profile, but would be willing to share if you were to contact me.

It didn't quite work out that way. There were times when I was employed, there were times when I was not. But thankfully I always had my trusty credit cards to pick up the slack! In an incredibly expensive city! Because I always paid promptly, the credit card companies kept increasing my line of credit and so on and so forth until I was in over my head. I've always been good about paying things off, but after moving a few debts around because of unnecessarily high rates, I'm at a point where I just can't pay 5 separate accounts each month. I need it all to be in one place with an affordable interest rate instead of the insane rates that my creditors keep springing on me. I've grown up a lot in 8 years and I'm ready to address this ongoing issue head on and I need as much help as I can get.  Career-wise I'm doing okay. Becoming a working actor is difficult but I've switched to becoming a working author and that's going quite well. I do kids books and other projects for DC Comics which has always been a dream. I still audition and am always hustling to book a good commercial. During the day I work in fashion which started as a temp job and turned into more. It's been a lot of fun.  Overall, I have my hand in a lot of different things that excite and invigorate me to work harder. The only thing that seems to hinder me is that debt that I've accrued. It also frustrates my parents who have tried to help and who are amazing at managing their own funds. Sadly I didn't inherit those genes.  I'm ready for a fresh start.

Status:Charged Off,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=274059,"I am a 34 year old full time Realtor of 9 years in Northern Virginia. My wife Karen just returned to her full time teaching position within our public schools of 13 years. She was in a shared position for the last 4 years so she could be home with our 3 kids (that are all under 5) and the days she worked I kept the kids. In that time she finished her Phd, reared 3 kids for 18 months each, now is obtaining her administration certificate & national board certification. I am fortunate enough to work from home plus I have 2 local offices. We need a loan to offset costs from not only education but the very expensive preschool. We have good credit (I was 729 just last week) and typically good income. Never had major defaults, never anything major at all. With me being self employed it is tougher to get a loan even though I have had my business for 9 years, 6 of which with the same firm. My wife just returned (in Sept) to full time work, we had several years of intented reduced income but we made good investments and am able to live comfortably. That time at home was priceless and worth every penny and sacrifice! We have retirement, mutual funds, college savings plans for the 3 kids, substantial life insurance (perm & term) but we don;t want to touch them. We have supportive families however elect not to go that route. We own lots of real estate. All have equity available. The 2nd biggest reason for this loan is to replinish what we spent to SAVE one of our properties. My wife inherited a farm house that has been in the family for 5 generations. In order to get the deed we agreed never to sell the property (must go to our kids) and we will not use the property for collateral or borrow against it. It was broken into and then abandoned 20+ years ago after Karen's grandmothers death. It was in disrepair. Karen's mom has been battleing cancer for quite a while. Both her parents are aging so we decided to RESCUE the house & outbuildings, fix them up, and hold a surprise Christmas dinner there for her family. We did it! Now we have a nice farmette on 6 acres that we own free and clear - no leins - and are using it. It's value is $300,000+. We also own 2 resort waterfront properties that have substantial equity in them however because they are worth 1.2 million, combined, 2 props deeded as 1, it is hard to obtain a loan using typical mortgages due to secondary market conditions and requirments. That property is planned to be vacation & special event rentals this year but until then it is a second home. We have little unsecured debt. Several credit cards have zero or low balances but 2 are higher and need to be consolidated. Our family Volvo is owned free and clear, my truck only has 18 months left to pay on it, and we have a Nissan Van lease that is up in 4 months. We own 5 boats, 4 of which are owned free and clear. 1 has a balance of about 7k. We have a newer HELOC for 88k used for the fix up that if someone is interested we would like to re-do so we can sell the other property that it is attached to. For now we can really use this 25k to consolidate existing debts, get my wife through these last few professional certifications, and allow me to finish my West VA realtor's license (weeks away) to expand my business. What is left I plan to pamper my wife with a small trip and mini makeover! After years of growing it, she wishes to donate her hair to locks of love. I think she has enough for 1 1/2 childrens wigs. Please help! I read about this program and it sounded perfect for our needs. This is simply brilliant! Plus we intend to do the same for other people as soon as preschool is done! I have NOT been denied for any other loans. I have not applied recently for any other loans. If it helps I am also an Eagle Scout!

Budget: I will be repaying this loan back with my paychecks each month.  Currently I bring home around $5200 per month.  My monthly expenses are around $4400, so paying this back will not be a problem.  I just want to lower my interest rate on my loan. Please see below for budget layout.

This application, VinyasaMT, allows the user to manage projects and data from anywhere in the world. All you need is access to the Internet. The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base – about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of Ford’s approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.   An average loan is small, usually  $75-$100 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for  60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $75.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the ship are: Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank. Purchasing gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry).

I started selling and financing mobile homes in May.  Basically I buy the homes cheap for cash and resell the home on a promissory note.  Since I started I've sold 5 homes - three on notes and two for cash.  I screen buyers for credit and employment history.  Generally I can buy a mobile home for around $2000 and sell that home for $7000.  I require at least 10% down and payments of $250-$300 per month.  My notes generally are 36 months – the same as this loan.  Currently I have a list of 11 buyers waiting for me to find homes for them to buy.  The homes are available to buy, but I'm low on cash.  We initially invested $15,000 into this business.  Right now the business has $5,000 cash (already committed to buying new homes) and notes totalling $24,600.  This is a GREAT business.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because the business currently has notes generating $928 per month.  The $20,000 I'm asking for here will buy up to 10 additional homes.  Those homes will generate an additional income of around $2,500 per month or more.  The business is currently making enough money to service this debt.  Additional funds are to increase profits. Outside of the business my wife and I have full time jobs and we bring home $72,000 per year.  We also have two rentals - one brings in $2150 per month and the other brings $675.  Our gross after tax monthly income from all sources is $9800.  We have no kids.  We are financially disciplined and we don't spend a lot of money despite our high income.  Just about all of our consumer debt is money that we've borrowed for investments.  We have only about $2000 in credit card debt that is not for investments.  My wife and I both work full time, we each run a small business, and we operate 2 rental properties with 7 tenants total.

With that being said, I have had to revaluate how I conduct my business in terms of what a proper investment should be in these uncertain times.     The value of an investment should consider, what would be termed the 3 ""P""s.      ""Protect"": the investment should be protected from any and all loses. Never a loss of a penny of capital.

""Prosper"": the investment should be able to achieve superior returns.

Purpose of loan: Payoff highest-rate credit card debt, which is currently 28-31.5%.  Getting another loan with a lower interest rate will improve my monthly cashflow.  My progress:  Today I have 14 credit lines with a revolving credit balance of 150K and utilization of 99% (result of recently paying down 2 CC accounts anc closing them).   My financial situation:  I have accumulated too much credit card debt and continue to work to pay it all off.  I have a perfect payback history: no missed payments or delinquent accounts.  My payback history in my credit files is perfect, but I have let some credit card rates get too high by some inattention on my part.  I opened some credit cards with low introductory rates on balance transfers but because I was late on a couple of the payments by literally 1-3 days, the credit card companies jacked up the rates.  Those initial low interest rate offers (e.g., 0 to 3.99% for 12 months) for balance transfers were tempting, but came back to haunt me.  My credit rating/score looks poor becasue of my high percent of borrowing vs. limit.  I've always paid back and will continue to.  I have no delinquencies or negatives on my credit reports and I'm committed to it staying that way.  Any form of negative mark on my credit report is not an option for me.  If my loan is funded, I will immediately pay down my highest interest debt .

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February. My gross income for 2007 was $85,000 with a base salary of $20,000 and commissions of $65,000 for the year.   If you notice on my credit report, I have not missed a payment on any debt. I wish to keep it that way and am looking for a loan to consolidate some of the monthly payments and reduce the total amount of my long-term debt.

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.

The business provides at-risk homeowners options to prevent foreclosure and keep their homes through lender negotiations.  The current owners are retiring due to their age and health.  The working capital portion of the funds will be used to improve processes and systems.  The business has not fully utilized current technology and I intend to convert certain manual processes to automated ones, increasing efficiency.  This increase in efficiency will translate into increased productivity, revenues and net income.  I have been a self-employed CPA since 2006, assisting clients in a variety of accounting and financial projects.  My wife is a Director in an IT department of a large publicly-traded company, and will continue to be a secondary source of income.  After reviewing several other businesses, this was the first opportunity that met both of our approvals.  The sellers are extremely supportive of this transaction.  Throughout the sales process, they have been extremely selective.  They met and rejected 46 other potential buyers before telling my wife and me that I was the first person that they felt comfortable to continue the business.  Additionally, they are providing ongoing consulting services for 3-6 months after the close date.

It's a large (over 1200 square feet), walkout basement with lots of natural light.  It's just begging to be a more usable area.  I want to add 2 bedrooms, a bath room (the rough-in is already present), a living area, kitchenette (microwave, fridge, and cabinets), and a room that could be used as either an office, exercise room, or spare bedroom.  I am moving into the house at the end of May and want to have the basement finished by the end of the summer.  I'm a math professor, which means that I can work from home some in the summer and have more flexibility with my schedule than I can during the fall and spring semesters.  Thus, I'm trying hard to get this taken care of this summer.  I'm single, and I prefer to have housemates instead of living alone.  I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for other young professionals with whom to share.  It seems that there are a lot of us who prefer to share housing, and I have had a lot of interest.  Thus, after I finish the basement, I plan to rent it to other young professionals.  My calculations indicate that this investment will pay for itself in about 4 years.   Of course, it will also increase the value of the home.  About me:  I finished graduate school a year ago, with a Ph.D. in math.  I'm now a math professor, which means that I do research in mathematics and teach math courses to undergraduates.  I am heavily involved in the mathematical education of teachers.  I like to teach math classes designed for those who are trying to become teachers, as well as professional development or master's courses for those who are already practicing teachers.  I'm currently a math professor in the south.  I'm a post-doc, which is a temporary 1-3 year position that you get after your degree to give you more experience so that you can get a permanent position.  It worked.  I will be starting a permanent (tenure track) position in Colorado this summer.  I want to settle permanently in Colorado, and I hope that I will work at this same University until I retire.  I'm hoping someone might remember what it was like to be at the beginning of their career, and be willing to help me out.

Unfortunately, this has been a strain on my schoolwork, but I have also kept a 3.2 GPA and last semester I even made the Dean’s List. I currently attend a major university part time and have been going to school for the past six years.  In the past I have been able to handle the stresses of working and going to school, but I graduate at the end of the year and I just found out a few days ago that I would need to complete three more classes this summer in order to graduate on time. This is very distressing news, because I work every single day during the summer months to pay for the following semester. I would like to graduate on time, it has been a very long six years and I want to be the first person in my family to have a college degree.  I do not want to push my graduation off any further.  I plan to graduate with a BA in Spanish History/Interrupter Education. I would like to be an Interrupter and also a Spanish Language Arts teacher after I graduate. Spanish language and learning about other countries has been a wonderful experience. I love learning about other cultures and studying this language has taught me so much about how other people live and how learning a new language has brought down so many barriers. So far I have not had a chance to travel oversees, but I plan to do so after my graduation.  I love attending school and I have been able to pay all of my education expenses so far, but these three classes will be a strain on me financially.  I want to be able to complete and pay for these three classes and always pay for the following semester and graduation fees.  Hopefully with this loan I can pay all of my school bills and not have to work part time so I can focus on my education and graduate on time and begin a new life and my new career.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

There will be a position in my company that will open up at the 4th quarter of this year, and I already applied for that position. I am one of the 3 people that have applied for that position and passed the testing.  Now for the final thing to do, is to get a Microsoft Certified Systems Administration, or MCSA. I have my bachelor from Iowa State University and my master from Webster University. Getting this certification will enable me to move up, earn more and manage more tasks and projects.  I'm sure I will pass the test; I graduated with 3.4GPA from ISU and 3.6GPA from Webster. When I get the position, the extra income will payoff the loan in a few months.  I have to take a class to prepare myself for the certification, and also the exam fees.

I had the system installed 23 years ago when we first moved into this house.  The last time it was repaired, the company could not believe how long I have had it - and they reminded me that the main coils will go out at any time.  I had 2 companies give me quotes for a whole new system - the best being $4894.00 all included.    Looking at the specs of the system and also reasearching this information, the new a/c will be much more efficient, almost saving me enough each month on electric to pay for the loan. Plus, living in South Florida prices will increase as the Summer begins and the demand increases.

After reading Suze Orman's book, I learned that this is the one time it is o.k. to accumulate credit card debt.  During the first few months alone, I was not making rent in a bi-monthly paycheck.  Since then, my business has picked up and I've branched into other areas of the industry.  The biggest venture was becoming a Stott Certified Pilates Instructor.  The cost  of the certification added to my debt with the understanding that I would be able to start taking clients after all the trainings.  My income is now doing better with the exception of having to pay well over the minimum payment due just to keep the balance moving downward toward complete payoff.  Unfortunately, the debt has seemed to be on a standstill for a while now.  My sister has had her debt on here and recommended that it was a better option to pay off the accumulated charges.  As a young professional, I knew it would be tough to pay off the debt without adding more charges.  It's a vicious cycle that seems to go nowhere.  Having Pilates as a third source of income has been helping with my bill payments, but  is still overwhelming at this time.  It would be a huge help to have one steady payment each month, instead of fluctuating minimum balance payments.

We have deposits down for all of our vendors, but now would like to get them paid off to ease our minds.   We would be interested in a loan with a short term, because we expect to make the expense back and more in gifts for our wedding shower and the reception.   We are still young and have short work histories with our current jobs, despite having steady employment and decent salaries. We currently rent our home, and have little by way of collateral outside of the cars that we drive. Therefore, it is hard to obtain a loan from traditional sources.

My wife and I are expecting our 2nd child and although we can get by as is, it would be a big stress taken off our shoulders to not have to worry about multiple payments. Plus, I know that this would be paid of in a few years..not the case with credit card debt. I have two credit cards: $2300 and $2200, my wife also has one credit card with $1000. Unfortunately these balances have rising so high over the past 3 months because of some medical problems my wife was facing and the typical car repair bill. The loan would pay all 3 of these off leaving me with just this one bill, plus one other credit card that has a $1000 balance but is interest free until may '09.

It's a 25.9% interest and I've been making payments for two years, more than the minimum, on time--every one, yet my balance is not going down at all. I owe around $3,500 on that. I've contacted them and asked them to lower the interest rate and unfortunately they're one of the few lenders who absolutely refuse to do that--they'll only consider it once the account has been paid in full.   I want to use the other $3,500 to refinance other credit I have to lower my monthly bills, so I can attack debt easier by slowly, but safely chipping away at higher interest rates until its paid off. I plan on being debt free in 3 years.   I work most weekends out of choice (in addition to my 40-hour a week job), to give me extra money to spend on debt. I know that sounds odd, but its helping me repay my debts much quicker...and helping me pay moer than just the minimum.  Rather than using this money to create more debt, I am using it to repay my current obligations and be debt free.  I have very good credit, and have never missed a payment on any account I've ever had. I'm not a risk for borrowers--I've lived in the same place for 22 years. I've had a very steady job for the last 5 years.   The benefit of funding this loan is you will get a constant return on your investment, and I will not default, as I've shown in my excellent payment history and you (while getting a great return) will assist me in eliminating debt.

I have been selling beads, used for jewelry and crafts, on eBay for approximately 2 1/2 years. I am looking to expand my selection of products to increase my sales.  My business has reached the Platinum Powerseller level on eBay and my sales are ranked in the top 5 of all sellers on eBay that offer similar products. With this loan I intend to expand my product selection.  The business model I have implemented on eBay is one that has allowed me to develop a niche market amongst other bead sellers. The type of beads I sell are sold by color and weight. The typical business sells these beads in a package that requires a minimum amount of each color. This can cause a customer to be forced to purchase much more than they would typically need to finish a project. For example, a crafter wants to make a pair of earrings that has 10 different colors in it. If they were to purchase the beads needed from the typical seller, they would need a package of each of the 10 colors which could cost anywhere from $3-$5 or more each. And at the end, they would have a lot more of each color than was actually required to finish the project.  I cater to the crafters who are out to save a few dollars and only want to purchase what they actually need. I offer all my beads in small quantities, allowing the crafter to tailor their order to match the project. Over the years I have received numerous complements from my customers, as well as wonderful repeat and referral business.

I need to rebuild the head on the motor(which alone would cost $2000) which will require me to pull out the motor.  Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.  It was from an AT&T wireless bill from like 2000/2001 which I settled and just popped up with a collection agency.  I called AT&T and they can't even find the account in their systems.  So now I am in the process of trying to resolve it with Pallisades collections.  I am also going to be interested in purchasing the home I currently live in from my parents within the next 2 to 3 years, and want to be able to qualify for a good rate on a loan.  Since I have no long term payment history this would be a good chance for me to build that type of credit.  I currently live with 2 other roommates who pay 90% of the current mortgage, hence my rent being so low.  Thank You Frank R.

The largest balance of the three is $10,214.67 with an APR of 23.40%. . With one child in private school and an uprising high school senior it has been a difficult year.  I have worked for DHL Airways for 21 years and I am in sales. Although I have a competent base salary, due to several company restructures, my commissions has been less than what I have made in the past. My wife owns a Real Estate company and last year was a very slow year for her. Her business is finally picking up, due to the fact that we live in North Carolina which is such a growing area, so we haven't felt the pressures of other Real Estate markets, but we seem to be playing catch up with our credit card debt. We have already paid off several credit cards (and we have removed them from our wallets), however with these last three even though we are sending more than the minimum amount required, it seems that a large part goes towards interest and they just don't seem to be going down. We have good credit and are homeowner's. If we could consolidate these debts and have a more manageable payment we would be able to pay off the loan easily just with our salaries.

The program is called the Certification in Quantitative Finance.  Website link: http://www.7city.com/cqf.php?area=quants&outline=cqf&course=cqf&country=us  The CQF is an intense 6 month course that covers all aspects of financial derivatives science. 80% of the delegates have advanced degrees in hard sciences and 90% currently work for major Wall Street banks. I also hold a degree in engineering from one of the nation’s top universities. The CQF is equivalent to a Master's in Financial Engineering.  I have been admitted to the program and have made the first 2 payments of $2,858.00. My remaining balance is $11,432.00. I am seeking a loan of $4,500.00 as the remaining balance will be financed elsewhere.   Sallie Mae and other providers (FASFA) have specialized career training loans; unfortunately, the training program must be based out of the USA to be eligible for funding. The CQF is provided by 7City Learning LTD based out of London, UK. Thus the piecewise funding.  50% of the delegates attend the course in London. The other 50% attend via their distance learning program as I am. This year’s class has 198 delegates. Record numbers!  Thank you and take care.

However, since I went into the program with 32 hours of electives still to take.

He was no longer able to pay for my books and living expenses such as groceries.  In order to finish out my junior and senior year of college I had to go into credit card debt.  Upon graduating it took me three months to find a job- during which I defaulted on my credit cards.  After securing a job by the end of that summer (2004)- I have never missed a payment or been late.  However, due to the high interest rates (20% in some cases) it has been difficult to get these debts paid off quickly.  I am hoping to get a lower interest loan- that is only 1 payment instead of the 4 that I am currently making- in order to pay these debts off as quickly as possible.

However, my current high debt is a reflection of a 4 year period when I attended college, paying tuition, books and such.  As a result, I am only indebted to my credit cards. I did not obtain tuition loans. Also, I do not have a car loan or any other debt, just my credit cards.           For the past 2 years, due to an increase in income, I have been able to pay a substantial amount of my debt off.  If you look at my credit report, you can see that I have no delinquent accounts and that I have paid off over $13000 of my debt these past 2 years. At this point, I would like to minimize my interest rate fees in order to contribute more to the principal.Furthermore, I have closed the credit cards that I plan to pay with this loan, which are listed in  my credit report.

One was an emergency loan I had to take for an MCAT prep coarse with a 20.25% rate ($2356), credit card with 19.24% ($1035), credit card with 17.76% ($2931), credit card with 16.49% ($1876). I know the $7200 does not cover that full amount but it will put a significant dent in the amount of high percent interest I pay. I am paying huge amounts on interest alone and would love to bring this down.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because for the last four years I have never missed a payment on any of my loans or credit cards. I have worked hard to repair the damage I did to my credit score in college. I began a new job 4 months ago with higher pay and I just want to completely eliminate as much of this debt as possible. I can pay my debts, I would just like to pay them off faster and pay less interest. My college loans are locked in at a VERY low interest rate (2.88%). I have no problems at all with my college loans, I just want to bring down my interest payments on my high interest credit cards & loans. I work in healthcare, an industry that will not be affected as much by the economic troubles that the country has. I am very secure in my position and this position is actually in training for a higher management position.  I am a good candidate because: I have not missed a payment in the past 4 years.

This will help me reduce the number of payments as well as reduce the interest rates on my debt.  I am also hoping that decreasing my debt/available credit ratio by transferring my credit card debt to this loan I will increase my credit score.  I am trying hard to increase my credit score in preparation for purchasing a home in about a year.  I am also looking at using some of the funds from this loan to start my computer consulting business.  My business will be home networking as well as home theater setup. I will start in the local consumer market. This business will just be something on the side that I plan on exploring. I do not plan on quiting my full-time or part-time job.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have now graduated from college and have a steady full time job.  My credit score is very important to me so making payments on time is a #1 priority for me.  Within the last year at my current company I received an 8.5% raise in the first 6 months and recently have been promoted to a new position which has increased my salary 34%.  This shows that I am a very hard working and reliable person.  I also have a part-time job working at a popular electronics store.

What I need this loan for is to cover my down payment and closing costs. I have no family or friends that have the spare money so I'm looking for this loan.  This opportunity is coming at a relatively bad time for me financially because i just took a 2 week trip to europe and left a good bit of my money over there. But it was a GREAT trip!  I am a solid borrower and will not miss a payment.  I have steady income and save money but I want to jump on this property a.s.a.p.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.

RTO is a business model that leases vehicles to individuals with poor credit.  If the customer stays current for the entire contract, the title is transferred to their name. The customer has the option of returning the vehicle at any time, the ability to swap to other vehicles as their needs change, and other similar flexibility.   Vehicles are purchased at dealer-only wholesale auto auctions. The average wholesale price on each vehicle is approximately $1,500-$2,500. Whenever possible, vehicles require either major transmission or engine repair, which improves profitability even more. All repairs are performed at cost by our sister companies that specialize in transmission and engine repair. We have a rollback we use to transport such vehicles.  The requested amount will allow us to obtain between 8-9 vehicles. The average down payment per vehicle is $500, with typical monthly payments of $360 and average contract length of 36 months. Assuming 8 vehicles, total down payments should equal approximately $4,000. These vehicles will generate approximately $2800 of monthly revenue for 36 months. Industry averages suggest that approximately 75% of RTO customers return their vehicles before their contracts expire, thus exponentially increasing revenue potential per vehicle.  Although the business model is similar to the proven BHPH (buy here, pay here) business model, there are many unique advantages, especially in today's economy.   * The title of the vehicle remains in the company's name, which makes repossession paperwork unnecessary.  * If the customer doesn't return the vehicle, it is a criminal offense and the vehicle is reported as stolen. * Unlike BHPH, since we own the vehicles, bankruptcies of customers have no effect on our ability to retrieve vehicles. * Since this is a lease, and not vehicle financing, rental agreements are not subject to usury laws. * Customers are required to have comprehensive insurance with us as the lien holder. We also have a sophisticated umbrella insurance that monitors each customer's insurance on our behalf.  Each vehicle is secured with a GPS device that can locate and disable a vehicle if necessary. With these devices, industry reports insignificant delinquency, repossession, and skip rates. Any necessary repairs or maintenance are referred to our sister companies, and performed at actual part and labor costs. When RTO vehicles are out of warranty, customers must pay for any required repairs, or optionally, return the vehicle – thus, allowing us to restart the billing process with a new customer.  The demand for our services is expected to grow exponentially. As the economy hits challenges, those unfortunate that must file bankruptcy have little choice in obtaining reliable transportation. Our customers are thrilled with the service we provide and frequently refer us to their friends and family. Because our sister companies perform automotive repair, we are flexible on mechanical issues when they arise, ensuring customer perceived value.   My financial situation: It is important to note that our company already has several hundred-thousand dollars of available floor planning funds. However, the fees and costs involved are quite expensive. For example, there is a monthly floor planning fee of $45 per vehicle per month. Annualized on a $2000 vehicle, the floor planning fee alone is approximately 30% - and that doesn't include interest, repayment of principle, and other miscellaneous fees. Obtaining funds from lendingclub.com would be a win-win for us and the lenders - by saving us money and allowing lenders a higher than average return.

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.  We both have good, steady jobs, and would be able to pay back all principle and interest due in 3 years or less.    A loan to help us our with our special day would be greatly appreciated!

Eastover owns/develops multiple real estate properties such as hotels, retail/commercial buildings, golf complexes & commericial sites for development use. Eastover currently owns & manages $8 million in property assets.    We are pursuing this loan as a means to extend our business into an Assisted Living development on one of our undeveloped sites.  The $6,000 loan will be used to perform an initial market study on the site (which will be completed by Maxfield Research Inc).  The market study will be used to determine the following:  • Analysis of the 55+ population and households by 5-year age group; • Analysis of household incomes of the 55; • Analysis of household tenure (owner, renter); • Analysis of home values in the Jackson, Mississippi area and the ability of households age 55 and over to sell their homes within a reasonable period of time and for what value; • Completion of an inventory of competitive senior housing products in the draw area; • Information on any pending senior developments that may have an impact on new senior housing products that would be developed; • Calculations of demand for various senior housing products; • Preliminary conclusions based on the findings.  If the initial market study reveals sufficient potential demand for additional senior products, then our next step would be to conduct a more in-depth Full Market Feasibility Study (which would require another loan of nearly $7,500 & would also be conducted by Maxfield Research).  This is our first time to use LendingClub, but we have been very interested in exploring its potential for our business uses for quite some time.  We feel that this is a great opportunity for us because of the low-risk small-loan that we are requesting.

This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have over come some really major hurtles in the past 8 years; divorce & relocation to another state by myself and have been able to stay afloat (meeting all financial commitments).  Unfortunately, my “D” credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of ‘making something happen’ with my life.  Within two months I had a position on the regular payroll with benefits and have progressed from that entry level position into a management position.  I am now one of the ‘go to gals’ for others in my professional community because of my integrity and experience in our field.  Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.  We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up.  By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.  I am hoping that someone out there is willing to provide me with the opportunity to continue to realize success and achieve future dreams and to continue the Lending Club cycle of helping others.

My Situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because I haven't been late on my payments, and I have a stable income since I've been working for the same company for over 25 years. I would like to take advantage of the savings in interest I pay by putting all of my debt into one loan. I have two credit cards and one car loan. The remaining portion of the funds I would like to use to help my daughter. She recently graduated college and with this economy, she has had a hard time getting a job. Her loans are coming out of deferrment and since I was a single-father, I was not able to help pay for her tuition while she was attending, so I feel I could really help her now by lumping a portion of her loans into this.  Below are the balances of my debt:  1. Washington Mutual -$2,500 2. Bank of America -$1,500 3. Local Credit Union (Car Loan) -$5,600  Totals: Approximately $9,600 Remaining: $10,400 to put towards my daughter's school loans.  I feel I am a great candidate for this because, just like my dedication to my work, I am just as dedicated to my financial obligations.

This loan was used to purchase our property and consolidate debt. I didn't realize it at the time, but I am not allowed to make advanced, partial payments to this loan; my only repayment options are to continue paying the monthly amount for the remainder of the term, or make a single payment for the outstanding balance. Had I know ahead of time, I would never have considered accepting the loan.  As I have been making payments on this loan for over a year now, and the original term is 5 years, my balance has been reduced significantly. With a $20,000 loan at the same rate I'm paying now, I would be able to pay off the remaining balance and my loan payment would be reduced by almost half.  Please note that I will only consider offers for loans which allow advanced payments. My income is rather significant, and, as I alluded to above, my plan was always to make advanced payments to the original loan. The LendingClub system only allows me to enter one current employer; I am currently work for both ThomsonReuters and for Comcast. I can provide paystubs to assist in income verification.  I hope you will consider my request and view it in light of my income and the fact that the new payment amount would be much less than what I am currently paying.  Thanks for your consideration.

Our small business Sunny Day Online, maker of quality websites, has been growing steadily with clients in California, Nevada, and Louisiana.  We have outgrown our office space in our Garage/Extra Bedroom and are ready to move into small office space.  We are preparing to buy supplies such as printers, laptops, etc., in addition to having a cusion.  About Sunny Day Online:  I have been operating some form of Sunny Day Online as a hobby for over 10 years.  What started as a small side job has snowballed out of control into a real business.  We specialize in Web 2.0 like websites with Video, interactivity, etc.  I started to get serious about the business about a year and a half ago.  I decided that this is what I want to be doing with my life.  I brought on a partner and we have been working away ever since.  The great thing about web site design is that there is not a lot of overhead (at this point). Sunny Day Online will be as successful as we want it to be and we want it be extremely successful.  As I will personally gurantee the loan, you should know a little bit about me.  I daylight as an Associate Information Systems Technician for the State of California and have been working there for four years.  I work in desktop support at my day job with Attorneys and Secretarys from the California Department of Justice.  I am married, have no children, and my wife is a substitute teacher working on her credential to be a full time teacher. I am trustworthy and will repay your money.    Sunny Day Online has plenty of monthly cash flow to cover a loan of this size and as stated above I gurantee the loan personally and I also have the money to carry this loan.  I will not mess up the credit score I have worked so hard to build.  Last I checked it was 760.  I will eventually be looking to get a substantial loan if this experience is good one.

I have made every payment regularly except for one. During a particularly stressful part of my semester where I was swamped with classwork and planning a campus event I filled out my payment and put it in the envelope and sat it on my desk. I neglected to actually drop it in the mail. This resulted in my interest rate doubling to a whopping 28.9% a month. The interest is drowning me. I work two jobs and working as much as I do is starting to impact my schoolwork. Two weeks of paychecks from my retail job make me just enough money to pay the interest on the credit card, but all the other bills keep coming. I don't want to ask my parents for help or burden them in any way.  In a bad economy, when prospects are already pretty dismal for a recent grad a huge pile of debt doesn't help.

I'm currently consulting on various small businesses that are taking their business online to maximize their sales.  ABOUT STARTUPSNAX:  StartupSnax.com, the provider of Daily Munchables for  Your Business, is a small business resource site centered around providing current and edgy content for the web 2.0/social media & networking entrepreneurial environment and to help anyone looking for a current site to find information on how to start their business cost-effectively (how about under $10,000?), time-efficiently (maybe in a matter of weeks?) and resourcefully (how do I make sure my business is green?).  WHAT DO WE OFFER?  With the resources of the industries keynote authors on various topics, we will be offering:  - StartupSnax Blog - StartupSnax Free Stuff! - StartupSnax Ebook Store - StartupSnax RSS Feed and Newsletter  The authors of these ebooks are major industry writers that will be using their current substantial sales platforms (their websites, speaking engagements, newsletters, radio events, online blogs and webinars, book signings, and various other PR opportunities, etc) to direct traffic towards our site in addition to our online marketing, SEO and online traffic efforts. They will be using the site as a marketing vehicle for their various works and expertise.   HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?  Ebooks:  Ebooks have been increasing in YTD (past year to date) sales more than any other product in the publishing industry! Publishers Weekly (www.PublishersWeekly.com) has been quoting that although various in-store sales have been down over previous YTD sales, ebooks have been continuing to increase with the lowest overhead and highest profit margins! Better yet, trade ebook sales (business, not fiction) have been doing well despite the hardcopies' decrease in sales due to the economic slump.  Fortunately, since we are only offering these professionally-edited, written and designed ebooks in digital format, we are saving the cost of printing them, and staying GREEN as well!  By offering smaller (snackable!) ebooks in a condensed format by major authors similar to the Cliff Notes for small business and offering these ebooks at an impressive price point of less than $10, by maximizing traffic, we are sure of substantial ebook sales numbers based upon industry trends.   Ad Sales:  We have not calculated the inevitable ad revenue that will be garnered from providing a pivotal ebook store and resource site into our breakeven analysis but it is a buffer to ensure that we are profitable in the first two months.  WHY DO YOU NEED A LOAN?  A loan is a buffer for guaranteed success. Each person and company should have an emergency fund of at least three months' worth of working capital especially in this economy. Although we could  launch without a loan, although difficult, we are ensuring the success of a solid business plan in the case of a substantial interest in the company at the launch and the need for fast growth.  My credit is exceptional and this is not my only form of income since I'm also consulting, but I always advise my clients that cash is king! In the effort to keep the marketing budget at its peak, I need a loan to ensure those efforts. Also, the ebooks are being professionally copyedited and designed for ideal quality and I'm utilizing an industry leader as a production editor.  WHAT CAN I SEE NOW?  You can view the parked page at www.StartupSnax.com.  Our blog goes live mid November with a final site launch slated for January 1st!

This money will cover all marketing, training, business cards, a website set up and all advertising that is professionally done by the company.   I have a full time job as a business finance consultant. This occupation has lent itself to my ability to start my company - having over 15 years experience in this industry. My franchise business will be both real estate investment and finance consulting. In the finance consulting part I assist small to medium sized business owners obtain funding by partnering with an established commercial business finance company that has in-house underwriting and the ability to fund deals directly or use a connected lending source. These deals have a minimum average amount of $1.5M with a 1.5% fee per loan which is split with the franchise. In the real estate investment part I acquire and renovate income producing properties.  These properties are purchased at a low entry value (under appraised value) - usually no more than 65% acquisition. These properties are then stabilized and provide affordable housing, often with the  option of government subsidized rentals which is guaranteed rental income.   I am a good financial risk for this loan because my business dealings provide my business with high cash returns on low entry business opportunities. I am highly experienced in lead generation of qualified business owners in need of financing as my W-2 job is as a commercial lead pre-qualifier/originator for an out-of-state commercial lender. Over the past year I have averaged on a monthly basis leads totaling refinance amounts in excess of $5M (with a 70% closing ratio).

My family has been in the retail industry since 1975. We sell low-cost, high-profit margin items such as basic work clothing, evening-wear, resort-wear, and cruise-wear.  Additionally, we sell silver, amber, larimar, and other low-cost jewelry.  Our profit margins are generally greater than 15% based on the cost of goods sold.   I also have a full-time job as a senior technology consultant for a prestigious consulting firm and make over $80,000 annually with a minimum 7% bonus.  I also have 3 investment properties with LTV ratios well below 80% and I have a positive net cash flow of $600/month.  My gross rental income is $3120/month with grade A tenants.  Our business has well-established, long-standing relationships with local banks.  Currently, we are comparing our options between peer-to-peer lenders and local banks.  Due to the tight credit market, the fees, interest rates, and points are a bit too high at local banks.  The loan would be used to finance the purchase of inventory and will more than likely be paid off early. Therefore, we thought lending club might be a better fit.

The amount of money from the bank did not cover our total costs to build so we had to use our credit cards.  My wife and I are both employed fulltime, she as a teacher, and myself as an IT manager.    Prior to the construction, we only had a mortgage and a college loan.  Our vehicles were paid in full, we had money in the bank and we funded our 401k(s).  We are trying to pay off each card, one at a time, but the interest rates on some are 25 percent.  We would like to pay off our high interest rate cards and combine them into one structured payment.  We would close or have the card limits reduced once they are paid.  We have recently tried to transfer balances to other low interest cards, so I believe this may have cause our credit score to lower a bit.    We have more than $2,000 each month to pay toward this debt, but the interest on some of the cards consumes almost half.  My wife and I both have a bachelor degree from a State University and are responsible with our finances.  Having been denied for a loan is so discouraging when we have worked so hard.

Status:Fully Paid,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=360327,"I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",small_business,Partnership Bridge Loan,220xx,VA,15.16,0.0,May-1987,680.0,684.0,0.0,33.0,,8.0,0.0,134025.0,67.9,16.0,f,0.0,0.0,24214.7180273573,12125.27,20000.0,4214.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jul-2011,611.71,Aug-2011,Sep-2017,659.0,655.0,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

My girls originally accompanied my ex to Missouri when she mobilized with the U.S. Army Reserve.  I lost the injunction to keep them with me in Northern Virginia during the period of mobilization.  My ex's argument was that, while mobilized, her job would be that of a classroom instructor, and having the girls accompany her would preserve the status quo (she was a stay-at-home mom before our divorce).  The judge agreed.  My ex has since demobilized, but has elected to make Missouri her permanent home.  That means there's been a material change in circumstance, so I've filed a motion to secure an enduring custody & visitation agreement.  My chief goal is to expand summer visitation to 8 continuous weeks so I can get the girls into activities near my home and do all the daddy/daughter things I miss out on during the rest of the year.

I am obtaining this loan to assist in paying down my auto loan so I can sell the vehicle.  I now have a company car with my job so my personal vehicle is no longer needed.  Unfortunately, when I bought the vehicle last year, I rolled over about $6,000 in negative equity from my previous car.  The vehicle I purchased is a Dodge Nitro (SUV) and as unfortunate as it is, domestic vehicles don't hold value at all (especially with gas consuming SUV's) and it has quite a few miles on it for being as new as it is since I drove it for work with my previous company.  Needless to say, I won't get the full KBB value for the vehicle.     I own a home and have a very good paying job.  My base salary is $77,500 and my bonus each month is between $2,500 - $6,500 (never less than $2,500) with an annual income well over $100,000.  My mortgage is $2,000 but it is split evenly with my fiancee' and have very minimal credit card debt.   Most of the credit card debt I have is because I front the money for my company (expenses such as lunch and dinner with clients, gas, etc) and am reimbursed for it at the beginning of the month.  The personal credit card debt I currently have is for purchases for the house since I bought it last year and I pay it off every month for the most part.      I have a buyer for the car now, I just need to pay down the loan when we complete the transaction so the pink slip can transfer between lenders.  I am selling the vehicle for $12,500 and I owe $24,500 on it.  I need to fix the quarter panel on the vehicle which will cost about $2,500 from a hit and run accident I was a victim of.  Once I sell the car, I will get out of my car payment as well as the insurance.    My expenses will be as follows:  $1,000 mortgage $600 - this loan $150 - Student Loan $500 - miscellaneous expenses  I take home over $4500 a month or so for the most part so this is well within my budget.

To give you a little info about me, I the 30 year old owner of HUSH Shapewear and Accessories. I have spent the last 14 months working exhaustively on  the R&D (research and development) of my brand's products, testing, designing and developing an innovative/functional line  for a broad demographic of women (ages 18- 50) I have produced an initial line of 30 products: Slimming/Bodyshaping lingerie and garments ie: tank tops + dresses(these pieces can literally can take up to 4 sizes off of a woman) Panties with removable padding, completely backless bra's, tag and bra strap ""tamers"", carbon filtered inserts for underwear, bra stap converters and comfort straps, portable lint packs and magic erasers for deodorant or spill marks, double sided body and fashion tape, invisible panties, a secret pocket for bras etc...   HUSH will be every girls best kept secret and Hollywood Stylists brand of choice for all of their clients red carpet needs. This company is my baby. I spent 5 years in NYC (my hometown) working in the entertainment industry in both Public Relations and Publishing. I've developed strong relationships with publicists and Editors at Magazines and have amassed an enormous contact list of over 800k clients waiting for HUSH's 2009 launch. These are REAL women who are ready and waiting to buy HUSH as soon as it launches. I have also built relationships with buyers at Saks, Bloomies and Neiman Marcus, as well as boutique stores in Miami, NY and L.A. who have pre-ordered inventory. HUSH will also be sold in the international market where there is huge demand and little competition.   Additionally,  I am currently building the HUSH e-commerce website www.shopHUSH.com. I have made it a point to fund my business with personal capital and not by incurring debt and up until this point have been successful. However, the demand for these products has exceeded my initial expectations (not the worst problem to have) and I am seeking this loan to cover a small portion of my upfront manufacturing/delivery costs. My business is one of the few that is seemingly insulated from the current economic downturn. History and studies show that women tend to spend more, rather than less, on vanity and beauty items during a recession.   I work with reliable manufacturers in both Asia and Colombia, South America and can supply more information about them if wanted. The margins on my products are good, typically 4:1. I am a safe, reliable borrower with a smart business plan and innovative line of products. I have a good credit history with little debt. I hope that you will deem me a worthy borrower and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.

I am a reliable payer and have no late payments in my credit history.    I am seeking to consolidate my debt because I paid for some graduate school expenses with my credit cards, as well as utilizing a higher interest personal loan.  Due to the current financial economy, I was not able to obtain a student loan.   I usually obtain my student loans through TERI, which is currently in reorganization and is not accepting new loans.   I go to law school part time in the evening (don't hold this against me for those of you who may not be fond of lawyers) and work full time as a senior business analyst.     I will be consolidating the personal loan, as well as some credit card debt.  The payment of this loan ($378) will be lower than what I am currently paying for these debts ($294 for the loan, $75/month for two different credit cards that I plan to pay off).   In addition, the interest rate on this loan is lower than all rates on these three items.   Thank-you for your consideration - again, I have no late payments or any other negative credit history.

I have saved up $6,500 in my bank account over the last six to seven months. I need roughly $5,000 more in order to purchase my first ever sailplane.  A sailplane is a small engine-less aircraft that relies solely on convection (moving air) in the atmosphere to stay aloft. It is truly a wonderful sport. Gliders can travel hundreds of miles, fly at speeds over 150 mph, and climb thousands of feet into the sky. This is my dream, and one of my biggest ambitions to do well in life. I am financing the rest now so I can fly right away in the spring when the season starts. This will allow me to save a lot of money because I won't need to rent a glider, which costs $60 per hour. I am always on time with my payments. My credit scores are 764, 760, and 773 (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian respectively). I am 24 years old and I have no monthly housing or rent payment as I am living with my parents until I am finished with college. The Sailplane I will be buying is in very nice condition.

I'm am currently shooting two feature length independent films.  These films are not being shot on High Definition, but all subsequent films will need to be.  Therefore, I must upgrade my camera to HD, as well. The camera I've chosen allows for interchangeable lenses.  Having this camera will bring me more assignments due to the camera's versatility, ability to shoot using cinemagraphic lenses and my practical experience with the feature films that I have worked on already.   I base this on the fact that I noted an increase in business when I upgraded in 2005 to a camera that was capable of shooting 23.98 frames-per-second.     Being able to offer shooting-plus-editing packages to clients at reasonable rates is a strength in the current economic environment.  After eight years of experience in my field, the projects of my client base are growing, becoming longer and more involved.  I've gone from 10-20 minute projects (documentary, promo's, PSA's, ads, music videos) to feature length indie film and DVD projects. These projects require more processing speed and hard drive space than the Mac G4 I've been using can handle.  I am able to pull together funding on my own to upgrade my computer, which will allow me handle more than one large project at once, and to author DVD's for my clients from the projects I edit-- better and more efficient for my clients, and more income per project for me ($1000-3000 more per project.)

My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!). I currently work as a paralegal and make $36,000 per year before OT, but also cater for added income, and I am very simple with my spending. I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.  My monthly budget: Salary: $2700.00 per month Mortgage/rent: $280.00 (I live with friends so rent is very cheap) Insurance: $56.00 Car expenses: $89.00 (use public transportation in Boston at $89.00 per month for train pass) Utilities: $100.00 (not part of rental agreement. Rent is one flat fee) Food, entertainment: $160.00 Clothing, household expenses $100.00 Credit cards and other loan payments: $465.00 (3 credit cards 3.99%, 12.99% and 0%) Other expenses: $39.99  Overall, I feel I am great investment, with a simple request.

I am looking for a Lending Club loan to pay off 2 high interest credit cards and pay off my truck  and possibly pay off another small  loan that my wife and I have together. I am an excellent candidate for this loan because, I can pay on time, all the time. I have not missed a payment or been late on anything in over 10 years.  I only have these three things left with the big banks and once their consolidated I will be free from the grip of ""adjustable"" anything ever again. I have learned my lesson.

We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up. By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.
